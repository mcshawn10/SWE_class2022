# SWE_class2022

Provided for the user are two texts of Dr. Seuss stories: "The Cat in the Hat", and "One Fish Two Fish, Red Fish Blue Fish".
To run this code, one will need to instantiate an object of the class StringStat by passing in the path of either file. 
The user may call on the methods return_stats or replace_word. return_stats will return each unique word and its number of occurences in the terminal.
replace_word will take in the word to be replaced, and secondly the word to replace the former with.
