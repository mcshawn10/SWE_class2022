# CS 5103 - Software Engineering - Coure Project Final

This repository is the final submission for the course project. 
This program is able to take in a given file and interact with the file in various ways:
- report word statistics of the file
- replace a word in the file with another word input by the user
- "grepline" which reports to user on what lines a certain word lies on

The file proj.py is the Strings and Words program. The file Test.py are unit test cases for the Strings and Words program. 
Provided for the user are two texts of Dr. Seuss stories: "The Cat in the Hat", and "One Fish Two Fish, Red Fish Blue Fish".
To run this code, one will need to instantiate an object of the class StringStat by passing in the path of either file. 
The user may call on the methods return_stats or replace_word and grepline.
